### About Me
I work at Cisco on OpenStack. I live in San Jose, California. I am a big fan
of Python and have a keen interest in Distributed Systems. These days I play
around with Containers too. I also try to contribute to open source whenever I
can. Apart from tech, my interests include traveling, playing soccer and
ardently supporting the team I love - Manchester United.

### About The Blog

Really, this is just a collection of "things about Computer Science and
Software Development I've learned recently". That's it. I will probably have
more questions than answers about the topics I post.
